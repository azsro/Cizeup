<h1>Password Reset</h1>

<p>To reset your password click the link below:</p>

<%= edit_password_reset_url(@user.reset_token, email: @user.email) %>

<p> Note: I am trying to get the links to actually work. For now, copy and paste the url. 
You may have to change a few things in it to get it to work</p>

<p>This link will expire in two hours.</p>

<p>
If you did not request your password to be reset, please ignore this email and
your password will stay as it is.
