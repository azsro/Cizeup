Other users can then vote on user’s works, giving positive or negative feedback and ranking.  User’s works that receive enough positive feedback and obtain a high enough rank are then published. \r\n\tThe ranking system works very much like reddit’s upvote/downvote system, or YouTube’s like/dislike feature. The ranking system also helps organize the website for when new users or casual users log on to find something to read. This way, they find what is popular, aiding it in moving forward and getting published. \r\n\tPublishing might be accomplished in one of many ways. The least likely option is to go directly to the printing companies to print a book, etc. This is the “hard way”. The more likely option is that if a book reaches a certain status, our website can then go to publishers, (both traditional and e-publishers), and have greater power in putting forward a book. \r\n"}, "commit"=>"Post"}

Other users can then vote on user’s works, giving positive or negative feedback and ranking.  User’s works that receive enough positive feedback and obtain a high enough rank are then published. \r\n\tThe ranking system works very much like reddit’s upvote/downvote system, or YouTube’s like/dislike feature. The ranking system also helps organize the website for when new users or casual users log on to find something to read. This way, they find what is popular, aiding it in moving forward and getting published. \r\n\tPublishing might be accomplished in one of many ways. The least likely option is to go directly to the printing companies to print a book, etc. This is the “hard way”. The more likely option is that if a book reaches a certain status, our website can then go to publishers, (both traditional and e-publishers), and have greater power in putting forward a book. \r\n"}, "commit"=>"Post"}
